# breast_cancer_dataset

Project Overview
This purpose of this project is to create different models that can predict whether the tumor is malignant or benign using the features.

Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is in sklearn library.

Methodology:
The data is splitted in 2 parts( train and test) , preprocessed by multiple steps , given to variety of dimention reduction algorithms and models to predict.

Required libraries:

    sklearn
    numpy
    pandas

Usage:

    Ensure you have the required libraries installed.
    Run the provided Python script.
    The script will output the model's classification_report.

Results:
accuracy of using pca and knn together was 97%.accuracy of using lda and decision tree together was 96%.accuracy of using genetics and svm together was 96%.
